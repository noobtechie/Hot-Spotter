# As Flown Code

This is the 'as flown', pre-crash, code used to monitor the drone and create a heatmap. 'Post-crash' code will be a more *sophisticated* rewrite of this. The code here can generate a heatmap on a companion computer in realtime and will return the current GPS coordinates of the hottest point.
